# backend generator
> this package is responsible for managing the generation of a new vangav backend service

> explore this package if you are interested in seeing how services get generated or want to expand on how services get generated; but there are no utilies here that one can use once a service is generated

### [BackendGeneratorMain](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/BackendGeneratorMain.java)

+ `BackendGeneratorMain` is the entry point for [backend_generator.jar](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/tools_bin) used to generate vangav backend services
+ it does its job by following these steps:
  + checking is the new service has config files (`controllers.json`, `client_name.client_java`, `keyspace_name.keyspace`, ...)
  + if the new service has config files, they get verified and exit the generation process if verification failed
  + creates a new empty play (play framework) project
  + edits the generated project to supress warnnings and add comments to identify the classes/files generated by play and how to deal with them
  + adds a [vangav mighty client](http://vangav.com/) to the generated service
  + adds [cassandra updater](https://github.com/vangav/vos_geo_server/tree/master/cassandra_updater) tool
  + adds default classes/properties that should be in all generated services (e.g.: [CommonPlayHandler](https://github.com/vangav/vos_geo_server/blob/master/app/com/vangav/vos_geo_server/controllers/CommonPlayHandler.java))
  + adds scripts (run, compile, debug, dist, ...)
  + if the project has config it generates and adds:
    + controller, handler, request and response classes for each defined controller (api entry point)
    + controller, request and response classes for each client's controller (api entry point)
    + java client, query methods, creating/dropping scripts and phriction wikis for defined cassandra keyspaces
  + makes the service eclipse-ready
  + compiles the generated service
  + generates a worker service if the user asked for one

### [defaults](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/defaults)

+ contains the default `CommonPlayHandler` and `Global` classes used by [BackendGeneratorMain](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/BackendGeneratorMain.java) for new service generation; during generation they get modified(if needed) then added to the new service
