**[BackendGeneratorMain](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/BackendGeneratorMain.java)**

+ BackendGeneratorMain is the entry point for [backend_generator.jar](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/tools_bin) used to generate Vangav Backend RESTful Services.
+ It does its job by following these steps:
  1. Checking is the new service has config files (controllers.json, keyspace_name.keyspace, ...).
  2. If the new service has config files, they get verified.
  3. Creates a new empty play (play framework) project.
  4. Edits the generated project to supress warnnings and add comments to identify the classes/files generated by play and how to deal with them.
  5. Adds a [Vangav M Client](http://vangav.com/) to the generated service.
  6. Adds [Cassandra Keyspaces Updater](https://github.com/vangav/vos_geo_server/tree/master/cassandra_updater) tool.
  7. Adds default classes/properties that should be in all generated services (e.g.: [CommonPlayHandler](https://github.com/vangav/vos_geo_server/blob/master/app/com/vangav/vos_geo_server/controllers/CommonPlayHandler.java)).
  8. Adds scripts (run, compile, debug, dist, ...).
  9. If the project has config it generates and adds:
    + Controller, Handler, Request and Response classes for each defined entry point.
    + JAVA client, query methods, creating/dropping scripts and phriction wikis for defined Cassandra keyspaces.
  10. Compiles the generated service.
  11. Generates a worker service if the user asked for one.

**[defaults](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/defaults)**

+ Contains the default CommonPlayHandler and Global classes used by [BackendGeneratorMain](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/backend_generator/BackendGeneratorMain.java) for new service generation.
