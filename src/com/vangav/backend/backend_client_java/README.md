> **why?** we need client services to do things like thoroughly test backend services, communicate with public apis like facebook graph, ...; this package saves 90+% of the times needed to develop clients by generating most of the code as well as providing the ability to use generated clients sync/async, brust calls (for stress testing) along with the ability to optionally log everything (requests, responses, success/failure, request-to-response times, ...) - generated clients have a client/server duality, along with aggregate/merge functionalities to provide flexibility and scale
