| Class | Explanation |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [NumbersInl](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/NumbersInl.java) | Has inline static methods handling basic numeric operations. |
| [Range](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/Range.java) | Represents inclusive numerical ranges and provides operations like shifting, intersection, union, ... |
| [Circle](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/geometry/Circle.java) | Represents a circles and provides some basic circle-operations. |
| [LineSegment](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/geometry/LineSegment.java) | Represents line segments and provides line segment operations with self, other lines and points. |
| [Motion2DInl](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/geometry/Motion2DInl.java) | Given two points and a step, it generates the points to go through from start to end. Useful for application like simulation. |
| [Point](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/geometry/Point.java) | Extends [java.awt.geom.Point2D.Double](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Point2D.Double.html) by adding extra functionalities like arithmetic operators, distance calculation, etc ... |
| [StraightLine](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/src/com/vangav/backend/math/geometry/StraightLine.java) | Represents staraight lines along with some straight-line-operations. |
