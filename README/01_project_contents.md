# project's contents

> 5-10 min: this tutorial explains the building blocks of vangav backend

following is a brief explanantion for the contents of each of the vangav backend project's top level directories

### [apache-cassandra-2.1.2](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/apache-cassandra-2.1.2)
+ this is the cassandra used by vangav backend
+ in dev mode, it's automatically used by all the services generated using vangav backend
+ for prod mode, refer to the [deploy](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/blob/master/README/09_deploy.md) tutorial

### [data](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/data)
+ contains the data files needed for using some of the built-in utilities like reverse geo coding
+ [vos_geo_server](https://github.com/vangav/vos_geo_server) is one example that utilizes these data

### [dist](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/dist)
+ contains `vos_backend.jar` that includes both of the underlying backend for all generated services as well as all of the provided utilities
+ the jar above is automatically included with all generated services
+ alternatively one case use it as a lib for any java project

### [doc](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/doc)
+ contains the java docs for vangav backend's source code

### [lib](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/lib)
+ conatins all the third-party libs used by vangav backend
+ all the necessary libs are automatically copied to generated services
+ the optional use of some utilities (e.g.: email. twilio, ...) require manually copying a lib or more to your generated service's lib directory
+ following is the explanation for each of the libs included

### [prop](https://github.com/vangav/vos_backend/tree/master/prop)
+ holds all vangav backend's properties files
+ generated services autoamtically get a copy of the necessary properties files depending on the project's config
+ optionally copy additional properties files to the generated service to use the corresponding utility
+ following is the explanation of each of the properties files, inside each properties file is a detailed explanation of exactly how to set/use each property
