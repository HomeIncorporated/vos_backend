# lib

+ This directory contains all the third_party libraries (jars) used for the utilities provided by Vangav Backend.
+ When generating a new RESTful Service using Vangav Backend, needed libs are automatically added to the generated service/worker. Using some utilities (e.g.: email, twilio, ...) require manually copying one or more of the jars in this directory into the generated service/worker.
+ Following is the explanation for each of these jars:
